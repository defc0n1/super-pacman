I am starting today the development of Pacman with superpowers, I believe it will take me between 3 weeks and 1 month to build the complete game with assets and the tutorial gitbook.

Today, I mostly explored and rewrote the sparkinlab [code](https://github.com/superpowers-extra/pac-man-like-game) to find out inspiration and a global view before to start the clone.

I also draw on paper a **quick draft** of what I want, a game start screen, a level selection screen, the game itself with the level selected and a game over screen with the score.

I already know there will be the classic pacman and the 4 ghosts, the coins and somes fruits.

I won't need to think much about the design of the game, I will do my best to clone the original from memory and follow my own idea in the same time, we will see where it is going.

I also started today a remake of the classic sprites, nothing fancy, I just need the shapes for now as it will help me to build the levels and game structure first.

It is a simple test made with the map editor of superpowers, no logic yet, I will improve the sprites as long this development go forward.
